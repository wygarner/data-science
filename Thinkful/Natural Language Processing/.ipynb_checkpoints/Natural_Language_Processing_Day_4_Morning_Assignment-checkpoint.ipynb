       "['HONOLULU (AP) — The University of Hawaii seeks additional funds for student mental health services, scholarships and other items in a new supplementary budget request, officials said. The Board of Regents approved the fiscal year 2020-2021 supplemental operating budget of about $28 million Thursday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The request will be submitted to the state Legislature and Democratic Gov. The university requested $2.6 million to hire 19 psychologists for the 10-campus system. The University of Hawaii Manoa has eight psychologists, the Hilo campus has three, and the West Oahu campus has 1.75 positions, while each community college has one position, said Allyson Tanouye, who coordinates mental health throughout the university system. \"The national standard is one mental health professional per 1,000 to 1,500 students,\" Tanouye said. \"If we add the 19 positions we will be up to one per 1,500. That\\'s how low we are\". The mental health funding would also expand programs to prevent suicide, reduce mental health stigma, provide peer education, and alert new students and parents to college transition challenges, officials said. The largest item in the supplemental budget is $17.7 million to expand the Hawaii Promise Program scholarship to four-year state institutions. The university has proposed a flat amount to cover tuition and fees of Hawaii residents qualifying for need-based federal Pell grants. \"This is looking to focus on the most needy students going to the four-year campuses,\" said Donald Straney, vice president for academic planning and policy. \"It would add Hawaii Promise on top of the Pell grants to cover the total tuition costs of students who are receiving those grants\". The request also covered staffing increases including positions for operations and maintenance, security, educational and cultural programming, and student mentors.

       " 'NEW YORK (AP) — Go ahead and rinse your cranberries, potatoes and green beans. But food experts say don\\'t — repeat don\\'t — wash the turkey before popping it in the oven on Thanksgiving Day. They say that could spread the germs lurking on your turkey in the kitchen sink or nearby food. But it\\'s been a challenge trying to convince cooks to stop rinsing off raw poultry. \"If your mother did it and your grandmother did it, and suddenly the (government) says not to wash your turkey, you may take some time to adjust,\" said Drusilla Banks, who teaches food sanitation for the University of Illinois Extension. Germs that can make people sick are common in the guts of healthy poultry and are legally allowed to be on raw turkey and chicken. The assumption is that nobody eats their poultry rare, and that thorough cooking will kill the bacteria. So it\\'s possible that two common causes of food poisoning — salmonella and campylobacter — are on the turkey, said Mindy Brashears, a food safety official at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The do-not-wash raw poultry advice from the USDA is relatively new and perhaps hasn\\'t caught on because it goes against the ingrained belief that washing makes things clean, said Banks. Participants in a food safety study offered their own rationale: \"If it\\'s still slimy — I\\'m not sure what that is. It just feels good to wash it,\" said one. Another said: \"My grandmother taught me that. She just said to wash all your food because there\\'s no telling where it\\'s been before it got in the pack\". Benjamin Chapman, a study author and food safety expert at North Carolina State University, said the instinct to wash raw poultry goes back at least decades when people relied more on visual cues to spot problems with poultry. TV chef Julia Child was among those who said washing chicken was \"just the safer thing to do\" before experts began advising against it. But food prep is a juggling act, and germs from poultry can be spread even if it\\'s not washed, especially when birds are removed from packaging. It\\'s why washing and sanitizing hands, utensils and surfaces are even more important. The USDA-funded study underscores that point. Researchers sprayed raw chicken with a harmless strain of E. coli and watched volunteer cooks at test kitchens. Among those who washed their raw chicken, about a quarter ended up spreading the bacteria to their lettuce. But even some of those who did not rinse the chicken got germs on the lettuce. There are other opportunities for germs to survive and thrive on turkeys: thawing and cooking. For thawing, experts say frozen birds shouldn\\'t be left out on counters since germs can start multiplying on the outer parts that defrost first. They instead recommend thawing in fridges, cold water or in microwaves. You can also cook a frozen turkey, but it will take a lot longer. And to ensure a bird is thoroughly cooked, they say to use a thermometer to check that the deepest and thickest parts of it have reached 165 degrees. Even after the meal is cooked, you aren\\'t out of the danger zone. To keep turkey and other leftovers safe, experts say they should be refrigerated after two hours.

       " 'NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials on Friday told people to avoid romaine lettuce grown in Salinas, California, because of another food poisoning outbreak. The notice comes almost exactly one year after a similar outbreak led to a blanket warning about romaine. Officials urged Americans not to eat the leafy green if the label doesn\\'t say where it was grown. They also urged supermarkets and restaurants not to serve or sell the lettuce, unless they\\'re sure it was grown elsewhere. The warning applies to all types of romaine from the Salinas region, include whole heads, hearts and pre-cut salad mixes. \"We\\'re concerned this romaine could be in other products,\" said Laura Gieraltowski, lead investigator of the outbreak at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials said their investigation led to farms in Salinas and that they are looking for the source of E. coli tied to the illnesses. Salinas is a major growing region for romaine from around April to this time of year, when growing shifts south to Yuma, Arizona. After last year\\'s pre-Thanksgiving outbreak tied to romaine, the produce industry agreed to voluntarily label the lettuce with harvest regions. Health officials said that would make it easier to trace romaine and issue more specific public health warnings when outbreaks happen. Officials never identified exactly how romaine might have become contaminated in past outbreaks. But another outbreak in spring 2018 that sickened more than 200 people and killed five was traced to tainted irrigation water near a cattle lot. (E. coli is found in the feces of animals such as cows.) It\\'s not clear exactly why romaine keeps popping up in outbreaks, but food safety experts note the popularity of romaine lettuce and the difficulty of eliminating risk for produce grown in open fields and eaten raw. Industry groups noted that they tightened safety measures following last year\\'s outbreaks, including expanding buffer zones between growing fields and livestock. \"It\\'s very, very disturbing. Very frustrating all around,\" said Trevor Suslow of the Produce Marketing Association. The CDC says 40 people have been reported sick so far in 16 states. The most recent reported illness started on Nov. 10. The agency says it\\'s the same E. coli strain tied to previous outbreaks, including the one from last Thanksgiving. The CDC\\'s Gieraltowski said that suggests there\\'s a persisting contamination source in the environment.
