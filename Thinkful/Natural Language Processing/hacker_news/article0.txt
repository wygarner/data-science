I&#x27;m mid-twenties working as a Software Engineer. I&#x27;m still working at my first job out of college and making just about $80k. Not FAANG salary but supports my cost of living as of right now.<p>Currently, my job is very easy (mostly spikes and research) and extremely flexible. We basically spend time just researching the latest hypes in the tech industry and seeing if the company can offer products in the space.<p>As I said, it&#x27;s easy, but also pointless and kinda boring at times. But I deal with it, nonetheless.<p>My question is what would the smart thing for me to do next? I&#x27;m still in the stage in life where I&#x27;m searching for &quot;happiness and fulfillment&quot; and want to try new things but I am also afraid of making dumb career decisions. Just for context, outside of work I mainly focus on my other interests (politics and government, filmmaking and socializing).<p>Should I:<p>1. Try to find a higher paying job? Bite the bullet and challenge myself to get a $100k salary job? I guess that if I&#x27;m going to be bored at work, I might as well be bored but making more. But I also know this will probably mean I will have to put in more work than I&#x27;m accosumted to. Also, I have a great work life balance that I would hate to lose. (I&#x27;m stricly 40 hours). But I&#x27;m also cautiously thinking how your earning potential lowers as you age.<p>2. Stay where I&#x27;m at and spend that extra time developing in the non-career areas I care about. I.E, getting more involved in my government and filmmaking stuff.<p>3. Start a business? Something I&#x27;ve spent the last two years researching and wanting to do, but I just don&#x27;t have any ideas&#x2F;problems to solve.<p>4. Something else?<p>Sorry if this is a dumb question. I wish someone would make a guide for young people titled, &quot;how to suceed at your life.&quot;
