Thanks to a mix of luck, hard work, high energy, study, drive, and self-discipline, I achieved most of the things I wanted out of life so far.
I got to a point in my life where I&#x27;m free from debt, free from mortgage, free from bosses, free from clients, and financially independent. I&#x27;m healthy, I live in one of the world most beautiful cities, loved by my family, surrounded by good friends, happily married with a kid and a dog. I travel, take pictures, hike, meditate, read.  
I got the full pack.  Yet I feel lost.<p>I&#x27;m 33 and I feel I am now wasting productive years, setting slightly more challenging goals week after week, chasing a moving target, and never actually getting it. I feel I have way too much freedom, too many choices, and feel paralyzed.<p>What should I do? I am not the kind of person who can keep living like this forever... I feel like I realized (most of) my dreams, but not fulfilled a real hardcore purpose&#x2F;mission.<p>How do I find meaning? What should I spend most of my time on?<p>This time I&#x27;d like to start really pouring my soul into something that can provide meaning to my life, without rushing into the next app&#x2F;side project&#x2F;hustle&#x2F;startup to temporarily calm my curiosity.<p>help?
