I spent 100+ hours developing a system that performs fairly simple functionality: capture screen&#x2F;connected webcams on  motion detection, add overlays, and save it as .mp4.  The system grew up to be a mess, so I rewrote it from scratch again spending 60+ hours, this time with functionality to capture sources in parallel.
It uses Windows Media Foundation API, written in 7000 lines of C++ code.<p>The thing is, it doesn&#x27;t work and has nasty bugs on slower systems, it crashes once in a while, sometimes has audio&#x2F;video synchronization issues, etc. - the bugs are mostly very hard to reproduce.  Prior to this, I considered myself to be a good programmer but it has almost made me reevaluate my decision whether I should pursue programming anymore (I&#x27;m a CS student), not to mention the toll it took on my self-worth and mental health.<p>The question is, what&#x27;s the reason after spending  so much time, the end result is mostly unusable: quirkiness of Windows API, C++, or just my incompetence as a programmer?  Or is multimedia programming by nature tricky?<p>P.S. Please ignore my username and new account as I&#x27;m too embarrassed to ask from my real account that gives away my identity.
