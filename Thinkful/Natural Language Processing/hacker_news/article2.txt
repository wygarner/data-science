Do you centralize your data? Do you run an iPaaS of some kind? Do you like it?<p>Context: I&#x27;m currently in the middle of a project where I&#x27;m hooking up an ERP system (SalesPad) to an eCommerce website (WooCommerce) and I&#x27;ve found I need to move many different kinds of data between them (Inventory&#x2F;Orders&#x2F;CustomPricing&#x2F;etc), and I haven&#x27;t found a good tool so I started building one.<p>Has anyone else run into this? How did you solve it? Did you like your solution?
