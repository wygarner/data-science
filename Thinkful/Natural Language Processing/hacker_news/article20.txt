Hi everyone,<p>I noticed that https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flash.android.com is able to access my local adb keys stored on my local filesystem in ~&#x2F;.android&#x2F;adbkey . It does this after pressing Get Started on the page above and clicking agree to the dialog asking you if it can access you adb keys.<p>How is this possible? Is there some hidden api in chrome that google is using to access the local file system, or is there a more mundane explanation involving some unknown api?<p>Thanks all.
