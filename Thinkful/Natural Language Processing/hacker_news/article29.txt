I&#x27;ve noticed instant voting on comments submitted lately. As in click submit on comment, immediately go to profile and check the score on it. Appears to be damn near instant (&lt;2sec even on long comments) so its not a human. Mostly up, sometimes down.<p>Voting bots are nothing new of course, but I don&#x27;t recall seeing visible bot action on hn before that I could see with my own eyes. Plus the both up &amp; down suggest some sort of logic driving it - even if crude.<p>Anybody else notice this?
