Hi HN !<p>I recently took on a managerial role &#x2F; project manager (I manage 2 programmers) at my work. Now that the summer holidays are approaching, my boss asks me, that during my holidays, I take my emails or that I be available to be called (~ 3h week).<p>He tells me that this is normal and that it comes with the role of manager.<p>On your side what is the vacancy policy in your company when you are managers ? Have you any advice on how to handle this ?<p>For the context it is a small business of 6 people.
