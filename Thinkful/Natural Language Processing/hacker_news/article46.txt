There has been a recent spike in HN discussions on the best tool for taking notes, as well as different note-taking methodologies. And I agree that there are good reasons to do so if you are preparing for an exam or writing a book on civil war (or a blog post comparing two JS frameworks). But for the rest of you, what notes do you keep?<p>I mean if I&#x27;m learning something new, let&#x27;s say type embedding in Go, and I need to refer to it later, 1 - in most cases accessing it via a Google search is much faster than referring to my notes, 2- in 6 months, probably someone has written a better explanation for it, which probably will rank higher in Google results, and 3- in 5 years, it probably is obsolete anyway.<p>More fundamental types of knowledge are not going to expire, but the first two reasons are still there.<p>I see the need for a more temporary note-taking, say what actions the team is going to take after this meeting, but I think that is not what most people on HN mean when they talk about keeping notes.<p>So my question is: what are the topics for your notes, especially in the context of retaining knowledge for the long term?<p>Much appreciated!
