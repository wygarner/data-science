Hello everyone. I myself, as a lot of you, have an ongoing side project (I&#x27;m an independent musician, recording from my room). However, I haven&#x27;t been able to drive people to hear my music. I&#x27;ve seen many of you talk about successful side projects with lots of users---I wonder, how do you find your first users, how do you promote your project so people see it? I know all projects are different, I&#x27;m looking for common steps one takes to get their first audience.
