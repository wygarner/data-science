Hey everyone,<p>Obviously the strength of our social groups and social connections are unbelievably important to the quality of our lives. A thought that is ever more relevant in a time of quarantine and unrest.<p>So as the question suggests, what&#x27;s a story of a time when you found a place you belong? Was it in a company, a social group, a place, a person, a hobby? How did it happen? How did finding it change your life?<p>..Or if you haven&#x27;t found it yet, what do you think has prevented that?
