Not sure if anyone shares this pain point. I’ve always been keen to form a study group with like-minded peers to learn and bounce ideas, specifically in Machine Learning&#x2F; Deep Learning: Computer Vision or Natural Language Processing domain. Unfortunately, most of the study groups that I’ve been joining ended up drifted away because of the weak interaction. People drop out because they don&#x27;t get the value they seek, they can&#x27;t contribute, and they would never have that personalized experience from those generic discussions. On top of that, if there is little or no touchpoint during the meetup, you can just watch Youtube videos.<p>I am organizing plenty of micro-scale study groups that capped at 4-5 members to heal my pains and help folks who might feel the same. I have been receiving 70+ interests from the community and successfully connect 20+ groups who share similar goals, proficiency, and commitment level.<p>If this sounds interesting to you, we welcome you to be a part of our 70+ active members community (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.boringppl.com&#x2F;)
