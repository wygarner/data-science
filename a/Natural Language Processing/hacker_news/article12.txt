Hi all,<p>I guess most of the people out there working remotely nowadays. But how does your company make sure it&#x27;s remote working infrastructure is secure enough?<p>I guess most of the people would answer this as &#x27;plain VPN&#x27; but I hope there are more paranoid companies those also care about: physical security, home router configurations, enforced OTP&#x27;s, secure communication channels, full disk encryption etc.<p>What is your company&#x27;s paranoia level - and what they do?
