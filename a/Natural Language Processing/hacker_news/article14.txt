Today software development looks pretty fragmented and complex depending on what angle you&#x27;re coming at it from. I&#x27;ve spent the past decade building web apps, distributed systems, infrastructure and all sorts. My feeling is that as a developer there is still so much that stands in my way getting from some local piece of software to something that runs and scales in &quot;production&quot;. I&#x27;m starting to rethink this from first principles and curious to know what others deem as the ideal developer experience for 2020.<p>Share your thoughts!
