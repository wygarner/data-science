I was frustrated with reading twitter threads until today I searched and found some good online tools that can unroll threads and let you read all in one place. And beautiful there are bots also.<p>1. ThreadReaderApp.com also has a bot
2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mythreadreader.com&#x2F; I think this is pretty new but seems better and fast. Probably get a bot soon.<p>Happy reading twitter threads.
