I got many kids in the age group of 9-12. The schools teach crap these days and the kids don&#x27;t seem to develop any thinking prowess or curiosity.
I want to introduce kids to various fields, and to name a few: BioTech, Geology, Astrophysics, Computer Science&#x2F;programming, analytical thinking, etc.<p>I cannot spend an hour or two everyday with these kids as they are not in the same place as I am, but occasionally I can talk to them on phone. Are there any books that I can give to the kids and ask them to read those and maybe they will develop interest in one or the other field?
