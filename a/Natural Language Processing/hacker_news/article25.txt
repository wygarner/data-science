Ok this is an off-the-cuff post.<p>Iâ€™d like to start an AI challenge.<p>I have literally zero experience in AI, but i want to present this challenge, and get HN feedbakck.<p>So here it is:<p>Ask me questions.<p>1. What area do you feel you are an expert in.<p>2 what do you feel is your strongest area in that subject<p>What is the easiest aspect &#x2F; hardest aspect of that subject<p>What topics should one know to understand the basics<p>What topics should one study to grasp the most complex<p>Who is the best teacher of the basics<p>Who is the best teacher of the more complex<p>What resources for both<p>What topics can you teach<p>What topics do you need to learn more about<p>What is the best method to learn about basics<p>What is the best method to master<p>Etc etc etc<p>So then you build a map of all the people who have knowledge in these areas<p>And all the people attempting to learn about them<p>And for lack of a better term, you begin to amalgamate all of this<p>And ultimately an ai can determine the best course to teach a particular topic based on all responses<p>And can transition into curating and recommending lessons and resources for next steps... track a participants progress on their understanding of previously completed steps by challenging them with questions, then later start integrating concepts and info from other disciplines outside of the class or topic at hand and asking many to address the question and coming to the ultimate right solution.<p>Iterating through old versions of this question and that question<p>Keeping individual and aggregate timing of how quicjly problems are solved, and rating the difficulty of the solution then, in time, estimating time to solution based on past result&#x2F;complexity<p>(Its the premise of a book i have been wanting to write but dont have the time to do so, thus decided id share the idea with HN and brace myself for the downvotes)
