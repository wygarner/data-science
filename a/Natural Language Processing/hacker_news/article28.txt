Hello everyone I am looking for tips and ideas on how you handle personal side projects?  
For example I am building a very simple web application, where I have rough idea what I want but I haven&#x27;t written any spec sheet or anything. I just code when I have little time....<p>ofcourse I have been developing this for past 4 months and I am almost finished but at the same time I have so many small things left to do and there are periods where I dont do any programming on this project for 14 days etc...<p>I am using asana for simple TODOs.. but those get outdated or I forget what exactly I am trying to achieve.<p>so I am looking for general advice and tips on this topic. thanks in advance!
