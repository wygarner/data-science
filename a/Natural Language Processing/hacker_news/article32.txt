I recently saw a post on HN that recommended (among other things) reading books that were over a century old as a way to reflect on how different things were prior to the ubiquity of technology (i.e. social media, the 24&#x2F;7 news cycle, smartphones, etc.)<p>I&#x27;m thinking of spending a week or so doing a &#x27;digital detox&#x27; and aside from hiking, meditation, and journaling, I&#x27;d like to spend most of my time reading.<p>Does HN have any recommendations? I&#x27;m open to pretty much any genre, fiction, nonfiction, or otherwise.<p>A few that I have on my list already:<p>- Meditations by Marcus Aurelius 
- Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville
- Crime &amp; Punishment by Dostoevsky 
- Frankenstein by Mary Shelley
