With programming I still want to actively try to memorize absolutely everything. Anki doesn&#x27;t seem to help long-term. I find it to be mentally taxing and would very much like to find a balance.<p>In terms of coding, what do you actively memorize, vs figure you&#x27;ll indirectly memorize through use, vs figure that you&#x27;ll Google again for in the future?
