I have the opportunity to draft a proposal to farm 100 acres of urban farmland.<p>It is iffy financially mostly because of labour availability. And costs. But. I am still going to go ahead and create a proposal for a working farm ..a kind that has never existed. An automated urban farm with a kitchen-sink&#x2F;duct-tape approach wrt available Agtech.<p>Even if it gets rejected, it will become part of public records(it is public land). I am ok with it. Maybe someone will take it up some day and run with it even if I can’t now...but perhaps it might go through..regardless..<p>I am familiar with how the previous farmer farmed it as he has been mentoring me for the past 6 something years with my own farm. I want to take all that and modernize it.<p>1. Starting with minimal and automated tillage.<p>2. Swarming robots for cultivation, weed management and data collection of pest&#x2F;inputs&#x2F;yield prediction.<p>3. Updated paperwork and certification. I want to create my own protocols, compliance and audit standards for automated farms. Including traceability and best practices.<p>Bad news: it’s super cost prohibitive. Because I have to be grounded in reality, I am going to chisel it to suit the project.<p>Having said that...I can’t help fantasize about cutting edge futuristic farm of the future..with existing Agtech.<p>Any ideas? Forget about the costs. Just vision.
