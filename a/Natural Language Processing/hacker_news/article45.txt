I have just accepted an offer for a junior developer role. This is my first job in development and I&#x27;m hoping to avoid getting fired for being incompetent in the first month.<p>I have a background in startups working in app support&#x2F;DB analyst roles.<p>The role I&#x27;m starting is a backend node.js role focused mostly on AWS Lambda&#x2F;API Gateway tech. The company is pretty small (3 people).<p>What should I focus on in the first month to have the best foundation? E.g should I focus mostly on reading the existing codebase, start working on small bugs ASAP, self-study on the tech stack areas I&#x27;m less familiar with, etc.
