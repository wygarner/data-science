My department is transitioning to be full remote and before I dig into it with my boss I wanted to know what potential problems I might face with my company when asking them to let me work for a month+ at a time from another country.<p>I plan on maintaining normal hours and my mailing address won&#x27;t change. My bigger concern is if there are legal issues. My company deals with sensitive data and has some compliance procedures that I need to investigate separately.
