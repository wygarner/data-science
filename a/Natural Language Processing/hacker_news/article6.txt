When using a link like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zoom.us&#x2F;wc&#x2F;join&#x2F;123?wpk=blah I need to solve 2 captchas, every time: pick name and solve captcha, accept terms, click on the link again cuz zoom asks for password even though it is in the link, pick name and solve captcha -&gt; then I join.
solve captcha = click on the Buster button, but still (also that fails sometimes)<p>Some features are only available in the client, why? (You can see all profile pics in the client for example.)<p>And other stuff I can&#x27;t prove (like we think the client has less lags).<p>I swear they just want that I install their fricking client, and I give up. Frick you Zoom, I give up, you may leave the browser sandbox and do what you want...<p>(No my employer won&#x27;t stop using Zoom... we tried)
