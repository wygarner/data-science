NoTo Font &#8212; An elegant font with glyphs for all languages. Google commissioned it from Monotype to avoid those rectangular boxes that show up when your font doesn&#8217;t have a particular character. (Those boxes are called &#8220;tofu&#8221; and the font name is short for &#8220;No Tofu&#8221;. This is explained in Monotype&#8217;s post). Context-Aware Human Generation [&#8230;]
